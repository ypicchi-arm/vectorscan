/*
 * blockSingleMask takes in a character set (as masks) and a string and return for each character
 * of the string weither or not it is part of the set.
 *
 * 'shuf_mask_lo_highclear' and 'shuf_mask_lo_highset' are 128-bit masks where each bit
 * represents whether or not a character is in the character set. The 'highclear' and
 * 'highset' in the name refers to the MSb of the byte of the character (allowing two
 * 128-bit masks to cover all 256 values).
 * 
 * The masks are arrays of 16 bytes each and are encoded this way:
 * Let C be a character in the set. The bit describing that character is at byte[C%16] and
 * within that byte, it's at bit[C/16]
 * As example, 'a' = 0x61, so the resulting mask will be: 0x00 0x40 0x00 0x00 0x00 ...
 * 
 * Assume both mask are 128b wide. If they are larger, the additional bits must be zero
